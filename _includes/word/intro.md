The joy of the free-diver, the peace of the loon, the patience of the turtle, and a touch of the ingenuity and panache of the great sea explorers (a [Jacques Cousteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau) or a [Captain Nemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Nemo)).

Tending my depths, plunging into seas uncharted, dipping into mysterious pools and emerging to share the treasures and tales I find there (and perhaps hiding a few treasure maps of my own).
