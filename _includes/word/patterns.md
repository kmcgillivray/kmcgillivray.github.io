## Patterns

On a day-to-day scale, the Year of the Diver is visible in simple habits for maintaining a healthy flow in creative, social, and personal energy.

In the personal dimension, this means more improvisatory and fluid behavior that matches my natural cycle of physical energy—things like [free running sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_good_sleep:_free_running_sleep) and naps (!), and light enjoyable fitness activities focused on breathing and balance (In the Year of the Diver I am quite literally going to take adult swimming lessons at the local gym). The "goal" of these patterns, if they have one, isn't to reach a productivity peak or numeric measurement, but to get to know my own energy better and learn more about how it can be directed in different ways.

It also means enjoying activities that feel like home, things I know from many years of experience bring deep satisfaction and enjoyment and put me into a mindset of meaningful reflection but that are the first to fade when I fall into self-sabotaging overwork and overcommitment—playing games, reading curious texts, daily journalling. These habits will be my primary warning buoys if I'm veering too far off course back into the siren song of overwork.

In the social dimension, I shall seek a medium between isolation and the bombastic broadcasts of social media and “networking.” This means a cycle of restorative retreat, correspondence with close colleagues and small groups (in person and online, both in casual conversation and longer form writing and simmering conversation) and occasional broadcasting to the wider world (social media). In general, I shall seek to be part of a convivial scene, and a lot more [turtle-y](https://www.notion.so/Turtleocracy-47a6df7692bf4e95a39504a73a50a295).

In the creative dimension, it means regular and frequent creative "dips"—small daily practices in a similar stance as daily journalling. Sketches, short writing, small pieces of code. Reducing self-shame in starting and stopping and increasing intermittent continuing, to create a landscape of creative moments and ease the pressure off of any one project or direction.
