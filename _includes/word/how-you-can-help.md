## How you can help

My biggest pattern of self-sabotage is over-commitment and overwork. It's very likely that I could dive in to too much at once, or focus too much on the dive and not enough on the beach. Asking me about the book I'm reading, or the game I'm playing, or how my last swim went are all helpful because that reminds me about the patterns that keep me on course.

Also, since I mentioned the fact that I'm not adept at diving into big life changes and decisions, I fully expect to be faced with at least one this year. So, when it happens, the best way to help me would be to sit me down with a cup of tea and let me talk myself through it, and check if I'm not too busy running around to hear my own intuition.

## What's your word?

I chose my word with the wise guidance of the [Choose One Word](https://learn.cleverness.com/word/vclvo) program by [Dr. Jason Fox](https://www.drjasonfox.com/). I'm _deeply_ grateful for the rich insights I found in this video series, and for the charming, caring, and generous space Jason created for self-knowledge, self-development, and self-actualization. I highly recommend trying it yourself, and if you use [my affiliate link](https://learn.cleverness.com/word/vclvo) Jason will send me an _enchanted wizard pin_ and a commission. If you do, let me know what your word is!
