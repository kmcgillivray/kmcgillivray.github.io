## Year of the Diver Style Guide

One way of embodying a word is "[enclothed cognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103112000200)." As part of my own fashion cognition, I created a Year of the Diver style guide, which I will apply to my personal website and other online "clothes" across social media and other online presences. Perhaps this will also evolve into calling cards... stationary for chatty letters... we'll see! This /word page is the first application of the style.
