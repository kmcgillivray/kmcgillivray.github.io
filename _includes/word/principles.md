## Principles

**Enjoy un-knowing.** To let go of the weight of mission; to embrace improvisation and the unknown.

In the past few years, I feel I've placed undue pressure on single "dives" or projects, expecting them to carry the weight of a "life purpose". In the Year of the Diver, rather than heavy expectations and calcified opinions about where a direction might lead, I hope to develop a mindset of _improvisation_, _enjoyable usefulness_, and _staying in the tension of not knowing_.

**Dip, dive, emerge.** To organize in cycles of immersion and emergence. _[Mobilis in mobili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Nemo#Emblem)._

I'll continue the pattern of deep dives into new interests, and experiment to develop better awareness of which dives might only be a short dip, and which ones I might revisit to explore deeper than I may have previously. By thinking in terms of "dips and dives", I'll give each dive its own time and space, allowing it to capture my focus and evolve in its own direction, while keeping my awareness on the overall cycle of immersion and emergence, taking time after the dive to reflect and recompose myself. The approach of my expeditions is not plunder and extraction, but deepening the well and leaving the depths richer than I found them, not depleted. I hope this approach will lead to both more meaningful dives and a healthier, more sustainable overall cycle of creativityâ€”a stance of _intermittent continuing_, _freedom_, _flow_, and _peace_.

**Correspondence and crew.** To join a party of kindred explorers; to participate in camaraderie around tales and treasures.

In the past few months I've felt a pull toward withdrawal and isolation, a hibernation that superficially seems like a path deeper into myself. In the past I've felt the pull of the other extreme, the need to lead, to be a Knight in the spotlight in order to find kindred spirits and establish community. My intention is to find a path forward that balances the need for solitude with the need for connection to a community. In the Year of the Diver, I hope to recalibrate these extremes in how I "show up in the world", tending toward a stance of _convivial co-creation, conspiratory correspondence, light-hearted participation,_ and a healthy dose of _sociable "aplomb."_
