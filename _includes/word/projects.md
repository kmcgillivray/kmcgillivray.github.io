## Projects

A few projects have already started to materialize this year. As I mentioned, I'll be taking a swimming class in a few weeks which will be a project that may grow into a pattern.

Somewhat unexpectedly, I've started streaming on Twitch when I'm working on web development projects. I'm not sure where this project might lead, but it's a fun experiment and it's given me a new dimension of motivation to explore a number of software side projects, both previous projects I didn't complete and new ideas starting to emerge.

Overall, I have a sense of wanting to polish and wrap up a few lingering projects I never quite got to the finish line over the past few years. Part of my cautious avoidance of the deep end is the self-sabotage of _not finishing_, and I'd like to revisit a couple of the most relevant projects and give them the gallery lighting they deserve.

In the [Rickshaw](https://buster.substack.com/about), I've joined in on a group blog which has been a lot of fun. I hope to do more projects like this.

Alex and I have a laundry list of projects we'd like to focus some time on this year, from some apartment updates to vacations and perhaps something new when the summer is closer...

Beyond that, I feel quite directionless, which is part of the happy disorientation I expect to feel in the weightlessness of diving. I'm curious to see what projects will emerge after a few deep immersions...
