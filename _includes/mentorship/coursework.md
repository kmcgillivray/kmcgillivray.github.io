## Projects and coursework
{: .b}

The course material is organized around lessons for introducing new concepts and skills, exercises for reinforcing skills, and projects to integrate everything you learn.

Projects are both guided and self-directed, aimed at building a professional portfolio and exploring your interests through programming creativity. Past students have made projects including:

* Personal art and writing portfolios
* Music players
* Web games
* A searchable beer directory
* Fan sites
* Sites for local non profits or local community initiatives
* A custom to do list application
* A custom chat application
* And many, many more creative ideas...

Programming learning will be supplemented with a range of related blog posts, articles, books, and websites exploring the vast creativity and wonder of the web as well as writing "opportunities" â€“ yes, you'll write more than just code!
