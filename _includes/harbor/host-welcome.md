I'm your host, [@kev_mcg](https://twitter.com/kev_mcg)â€”jolly [web gardener](https://kmcgillivray.github.io/latenightcodeclub/), jaunty sketcher-of-qwerty-and-[canvas](/sketchbook), and [convivial home cook](https://fennelandradish.netlify.app/).

In the studio, you'll find loose manuscripts on [practicing creativity](https://practicingcreativity.kevinmcgillivray.net/), [pattern languages](https://kmcgillivray.github.io/a-web-pattern-language/), and [arcane logs](/archive). In the kitchen, there are odes to vegetables, and [half-painted portraits](/sketchbook). Later on we can gather 'round the table to roll the D20 in the [metagame of myth, metaphor, and meaning](https://medium.com/foolish-journey/the-game-of-quality-b506f98d8c4e).

Signal your address and I'll send you [letters in bottles](https://patternworkshop.substack.com).
