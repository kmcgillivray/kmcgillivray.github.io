# Welcome to the cozy lighthouse in the cove
{: .f1 .lh-title .mt0}

I'm your host, [@kev_mcg](https://twitter.com/kev_mcg)â€”intrepid [web diving](/code) companion, jaunty poet-of-[qwerty](/writing)-and-[canvas](/sketchbook), and [convivial home cook](https://fennelandradish.netlify.app/).

In the studio, you may find loose manuscripts on [pattern languages](https://kmcgillivray.github.io/a-web-pattern-language/), [practicing creativity](https://practicingcreativity.kevinmcgillivray.net/), and [diving logs](/code). In the kitchen, there are [odes to vegetables](/writing), and [half-painted portraits](/sketchbook). Later on we can gather 'round the table to roll the D20 in the metagame of myth, metaphor, and meaning.
