I'm Kevin McGillivray. In the _game of Quality_, I (con)currently wear the costumes of pattern-speaking [web diver](/code), jaunty poet-of-[qwerty](/writing)-and-[canvas](/sketchbook), and convivial home cook. I'm writing about [pattern languages](https://kmcgillivray.github.io/a-web-pattern-language/), [practicing creativity](https://practicingcreativity.kevinmcgillivray.net/), and the metagame of myth, metaphor, and meaning. Signal your address and I'll send you [letters in bottles](https://tinyletter.com/kmcgillivray).
