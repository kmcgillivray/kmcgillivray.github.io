I"Ç	<p>Markdown is great for writing because itâ€™s simple and fast, but sometimes that simplicity comes with limitations. It can be difficult to create anything more complex than basic elements like headings and lists. Recently on this blog I wanted to include an image in a post with a caption, and there wasnâ€™t an elegant Markdown way to do so. As an alternative, Jekyllâ€™s includes feature is a great way to create easy to manage image captions. Hereâ€™s how it works.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-html">1. The HTML</h2>

<p>First, set up an HTML partial in the Jekyll <code class="highlighter-rouge">_includes</code> folder named <code class="highlighter-rouge">image.html</code>. Mine looks like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/img/{{ include.file }}"</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">"{{ include.description }}"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>  
<span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"caption"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>{{ include.description }}<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="2-including-the-file">2. Including the file</h2>

<p>Notice the <code class="highlighter-rouge">{{ include.description }}</code> tag in the HTML? We can pass variables into the include just like attaching variables to posts and pages in Jekyll.</p>

<p>Add the include file to your postâ€™s Markdown file and add an image and caption using the include syntax below and fill in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">file</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">description</code> attributes:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">---
layout: post
title: Image Caption Example
---

{% include image.html file="image-name.jpg" description="This is an image." %}</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="see-it-in-action">See it in action</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s the final result!</p>

<p><img src="/img//sketchbook-project/11-alcatraz.jpg" alt="Sketch of Alcatraz and Angel Island. San Francisco, CA." />
<span class="caption">Sketch of Alcatraz and Angel Island. San Francisco, CA.</span></p>

<p>This solution avoids writing any HTML directly in the Markdown file, and avoids unsemantic styling of heading elements to create captions.</p>

<p>Good luck and have fun. Letâ€™s talk on <a href="http://twitter.com/kev_mcg">Twitter</a> if you have any questions.</p>
