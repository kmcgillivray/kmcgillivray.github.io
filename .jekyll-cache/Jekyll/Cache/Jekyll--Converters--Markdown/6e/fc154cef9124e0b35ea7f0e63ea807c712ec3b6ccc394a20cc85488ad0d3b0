I"¸<p>In the morning, we are called to the kitchen. It calls the people in the house to circulate, to make their daily greetings, to spark the fire of today. The kitchen is the departure point for the dayâ€™s journey, the transition from now to then.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, when rest is calling, the light in the kitchen is the sighing signal. When it goes out, the people know itâ€™s time for couches and beds. The curtain is pulled, the counters wiped, the stage reset for the next dayâ€™s play. The kitchen is closed, open only to midnight snackers and the cat.</p>

<p>Forever we are called to kitchens. The cafes wait to welcome us, the espresso machine listens for the click to flip on its heater. While the cafes buzz the restaurants are peaceful, quiet, then burst into action of cooks and servers and wild chopping of garlic. A sign of peace, a sign of freedom, a sign of people called together: the hand on the kitchen light switch.</p>
