I"è<p>On either side of my TV are two lions. Kings of the pride, dignified. Defending the portal of my entertainment like they own the place.</p>

<p>Beautiful sculptures, capturing a feeling of life in aesthetics. Replicas of the ones outside the Art Institute of Chicago. Cultural cats. Alex calls them â€œFelixâ€ and â€œOlafâ€.</p>

<p>How did Daniel feel in that lionâ€™s den? Can I even imagine? When you commune with cats, is there a part of you that doesnâ€™t go a little wild?</p>
