<p>The course material is organized around lessons for introducing new concepts and skills, exercises for reinforcing skills, and projects to integrate everything you learn.</p>

<p>Projects are both guided and self-directed, aimed at building a professional portfolio and exploring your interests through programming creativity. Past students have made projects including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personal art and writing portfolios</li>
  <li>Music players</li>
  <li>Web games</li>
  <li>A searchable beer directory</li>
  <li>Fan sites</li>
  <li>Sites for local non profits or local community initiatives</li>
  <li>A custom to do list application</li>
  <li>A custom chat application</li>
  <li>And many, many more creative ideas…</li>
</ul>

<p>Programming learning will be supplemented with a range of related blog posts, articles, books, and websites exploring the vast creativity and wonder of the web as well as writing “opportunities” – yes, you’ll write more than just code!</p>
