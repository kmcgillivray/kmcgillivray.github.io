I"Š<p>You canâ€™t predict when an interaction is going to make an impression on you.</p>

<p>Tony the Lyft driver made an impression on me today.</p>

<hr />

<p>â€œHowâ€™s your morning going?â€</p>

<p>This is a question Iâ€™m not prepared for. How does any morning go? Wake up, then actually wake up, shake off the sleep, and get on with the day.</p>

<p>â€œGood,â€ I say. â€œA little early.â€</p>

<hr />

<p>Tony has water bottles in the back of his car for his guests.</p>

<p>Tony is listening to Ellie Goulding.</p>

<p>Tony has been to Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Tony grew up in Oakland.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m shocked at how quickly he finds something in common with me. At how quickly he makes me feel like he understands everything from my perspective.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™ve been to Madison. And to Chippewa Falls, to see the Leinenkugel Brewery.â€ These are names that are familiar to me, words that echo around until in my head they mean â€œhome.â€</p>

<p>â€œPeople who grew up in California donâ€™t appreciate their climate. I visited New York in the winter one time and I was shocked that people lived that way. Californians donâ€™t realize that people in so many places spend half the year indoors. They see rain and complain that itâ€™s awful. But they donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to fear the weather.â€</p>

<p>I agree with him. But I wonder what a daily passing thought about earthquakes does to a stateâ€™s collective psyche.</p>

<p>But still, Tony knows how I feel.</p>

<p>Within three minutes of meeting me, Tony has given me a gift (water), found common ground (a knowledge of locations in Wisconsin and a shared taste in music), and demonstrated that he can see the current situation from my perspective (a Midwesterner in California in the rain).</p>

<p>Tony is a master of the conversational arts.</p>

<p>Tony makes an impression.</p>

<p>Also, Tony thinks my name is Foster because Foster got the Lyft for me.</p>
