  <p>–Marie Kondo</p>

<p>As I sit beneath worshipful skies, drink the tea, watch birds fly, beneath the many layered roofs of modern apartment living, the layercake of humanity. A spacious moment for morning rest, warm gratitude in my chest. Books and flowers and food and video games—objects to build a nest. Sunlight, lamplight, candlelight, keeping watch from morning to night.</p>

<hr />

<p>My earliest memories are of sanctuaries. Rooms of worship and gathering. Long pews, tall ceilings, bright music, dim lights, colorful windows. This is the inheritance of the son of a minister, of parents in love with nature. When I am lost I can return to this sanctuary, the memory of the patient care and affectionate attention of childhood, playing Pokémon beneath a church pew.</p>

<hr />

<p>Shelter, refuge, sanctuary, home.</p>

<p>A sanctuary is not just a gift or a treasure, it’s an essential ingredient for life, for survival, for humanity.</p>

<p>Lost seeds of humanity, scattered, searching for a new home.</p>
