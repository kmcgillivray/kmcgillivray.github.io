<p>â€œItâ€™s <a href="/kazuko">Kazuko</a>!â€</p>

<p>I wasnâ€™t sure if I would see her again at the marketâ€”it had been over a year since last time. But there she was, with her table of tea bowls and pottery.</p>

<p>Pottery is one of the great achievements of human culture. We take it for granted now, but itâ€™s an essential technology.</p>

<p>I am pure joy. I am touching all the tea bowls.</p>

<p>â€œHi, Kazuko!â€ She stops and wonders why I know her name, then she starts to remember. â€œWe met last year.â€</p>

<p>I make the smallest of small talk. I ask about one of the piecesâ€”it looks like a round teapot with a flat top. She says itâ€™s for Japanese calligraphy. I tell her I thought maybe it was a teapot and she laughs at me. â€œImagine trying to make tea with that!â€ Then she whispers to let me in on a joke, â€œSome people think itâ€™s for soy sauce.â€</p>

<p>One of the tea bowlsâ€¦ I canâ€™t stop looking at it. It reminds me of the famous â€œTwilightâ€ tea bowl. Similar color, similar texture. Both priceless to me. I submit to its call and I buy it.</p>

<p>She points to a navy blue tray, an organic shape living on the table. â€œDo you like this?â€ â€œYes itâ€™s beautiful.â€ â€œI give it away. Iâ€™d rather give things to people I know.â€ Iâ€™m in shock. Gifts are multiplicities. Giving it away returns it in an exponent. Farmersâ€™ markets are gift centers of the community, a spinning center of gift economy. Whitman said, â€œI am large. I contain multitudes.â€ In this gift holds the entire force of care and bonds of the entire community.</p>

<p>I thank her, of course. I wait for the center to spin again and for us to cross paths in unknown futures.</p>

<p>Walking home, we see two flowers carved in the stone above a window. A detail of home that we never noticed before. Cycles of community marked by flowers and stone, gifts of enthusiasm and discovery.</p>
