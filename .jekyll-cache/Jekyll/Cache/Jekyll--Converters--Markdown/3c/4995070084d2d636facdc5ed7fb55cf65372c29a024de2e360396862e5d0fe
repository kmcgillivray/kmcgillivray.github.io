I"–<p>Iâ€™m in the kind of motel where they hang a fly swatter on the wall because thereâ€™s a good chance youâ€™ll need it. Alex is wearing the kind of outfit you wear on vacation, especially the hat. I wear my normal clothes because Iâ€™m not sure vacations require much thought about outfits but obviously they do. You canâ€™t just wear your normal clothes, you have to look like youâ€™re on vacation.</p>
