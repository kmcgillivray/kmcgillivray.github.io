I"X<p>I take painting lessons from John Gordon, who runs a studio called <a href="http://newmasters.com">New Masters</a>. He tends to say funny/inspiring/interesting/confusing things during class and sometimes I write them down so I can remember them (or try to figure them out later in the case of the confusing ones). Here are some of them.</p>
