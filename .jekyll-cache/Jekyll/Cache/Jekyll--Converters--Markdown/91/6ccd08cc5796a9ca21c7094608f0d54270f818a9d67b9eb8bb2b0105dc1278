<p>I take painting lessons from John Gordon, who runs a studio called <a href="http://newmasters.com">New Masters</a>. He tends to say funny/inspiring/interesting/confusing things during class and sometimes I write them down so I can remember them (or try to figure them out later in the case of the confusing ones). Here are some of them.</p>

<p><em>John Gordon:</em> Are you thinking about art?<br />
<em>Student:</em> Yes.<br />
<em>JG:</em> Don’t. Art just happens.</p>

<p>“I think what you’re doing here is drawing a bird. We don’t do that here. Lines.”</p>

<h2 id="about-comfort-and-challenge">About comfort and challenge:</h2>

<p>“It’s always good to push yourself beyond what you can do. You’ll develop so much faster by taking on things that are too hard.”</p>

<p>“If you’re comfortable, not much good can happen.”</p>

<h2 id="about-the-role-of-intuition">About the role of intuition:</h2>

<p>“Whenever you get that feeling, do it. Spontaneous. Faster than you want to.”</p>

<p>“We have knowledge that is dormant. The only way to use it is… follow your impulses, mop up afterward if you have to.”</p>

<h2 id="about-making-mistakes">About making mistakes:</h2>

<p>“When you’re learning, it’s better to err on the side of <em>not</em> caution.”</p>

<p>“I’ve done this enough that I don’t worry about how dumb it looks.”</p>

<p>“The first step has to be big enough.”</p>

<p>“Even if you blow this, just the effort to find the truth gives power to a picture.”</p>

<p>“Fast and wrong is better than slow and wrong.”</p>

<p>“There’s no such thing as going too far because you can always take it back.”</p>

<h2 id="about-getting-started">About getting started:</h2>

<p>“Get in there. Make it worth caring about.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes you have to make it wrong to get back into it.”</p>

<h2 id="about-confidence">About confidence:</h2>

<p>“Do you know hard this is? I’m convinced you can do it.”</p>

<p>“You have to accept yourself as potentially a very good artist.”</p>

<h2 id="about-patience">About patience:</h2>

<p><em>Student:</em> It could take a while.<br />
<em>John Gordon:</em> That’s all right. There are no deadlines in this course.</p>

<p>“Wanting to get done with something is not a good reason for doing it.”</p>

<h2 id="about-perfection">About perfection:</h2>

<p>“You have to get over that. You’ll do 1/100th of the number of pictures in your life if you don’t.”</p>

<p><em>Student:</em> Should I worry about that?<br />
<em>John Gordon:</em> Worry? I wouldn’t worry. Just take care of it. The first attempt won’t always be spot on.</p>
