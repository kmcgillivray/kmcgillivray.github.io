I"Ì<p>You never know what roads youâ€™ll walk down twice. Do we move down the road, or do we stand still and the moments and places come to us?</p>

<p>â€œI should have brought avocados with me!â€</p>

<p>Four people sip coffee on the front porch. The James remains in the slumber room.</p>

<p>The gravel parking area in front of the cabin is a landscape of peaceâ€”each piece of rock celebrating quiet and sun. They stay still, but donâ€™t they experience just as much as us? People coming and going every day, each moment a different quality of sunlight. Every moment is a new adventure whether youâ€™re staying still or not.</p>

<p>My goal for the weekend (if youâ€™re allowed to have goals in vacation world) is to be as still as possible, even if Iâ€™m moving around. To view myself as the still point and meet the world in each moment.</p>

<p>As Lady Gaga says, to enjoy the gift of life, to do that and nothing else.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m going to have another cup of coffee.â€</p>

<p>â€œYeah, Iâ€™m about to have another one too.â€</p>

<p>â€œCan I read that when youâ€™re done, lady?â€</p>

<p>I sit cross-legged in the chair, trying to be the <a href="/making-is-breathing">buddha in the breeze</a>. But I think Iâ€™m more like the gravel in the driveway, seeing the whole world by standing still.</p>

<p>â€œLook around, look around, how lucky we are to be alive right now.â€</p>

<p>This is our <a href="/crossroads">second visit</a> to the Crossroads Motel.</p>
