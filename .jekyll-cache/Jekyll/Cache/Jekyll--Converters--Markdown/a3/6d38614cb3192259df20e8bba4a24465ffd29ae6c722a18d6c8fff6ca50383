I"ƒ<p>Iâ€™m in the kind of motel where they hang a fly swatter on the wall because thereâ€™s a good chance youâ€™ll need it. Alex is wearing the kind of outfit you wear on vacation, especially the hat. I wear my normal clothes because Iâ€™m not sure vacations require much thought about outfits but obviously they do. You canâ€™t just wear your normal clothes, you have to look like youâ€™re on vacation.</p>

<p>â€œDo you know where the cabin is? Over there, to the left. Itâ€™s <em>not</em> the one with the teepees in front of it.â€</p>

<p>Foster says that Wisconsin is the best place to be for the Fourth of July. I have to agree. Nothing is more in-between metropolitan and rural, more a mix of America.</p>

<p>James refuses to not shower. Everyone is pissed.</p>

<p>â€œWho cares what you look like in Montello?!â€</p>

<p>He replies, â€œHaters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.â€</p>

<p>â€œWeâ€™re walking down to Ed and Lauraâ€™s. Cabin 17. Think you can find it?â€</p>

<p>â€œDonâ€™t leave me!â€</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s the one without teepees.â€</p>

<p>â€œWithout what?â€</p>

<p>â€œTeepees.â€</p>

<hr />

<p>An old man sits outside the motel office. We leave our room and he greets us, â€œGood morning.â€</p>

<p>This is the kind of place where people greet you from 75 feet away. The greeting radius is wider here.</p>

<p>This is our first night in the Crossroads Motel.</p>
