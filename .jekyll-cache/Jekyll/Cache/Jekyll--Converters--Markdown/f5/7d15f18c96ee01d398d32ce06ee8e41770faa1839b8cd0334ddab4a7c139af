  <p>The only way we can stay with something for a sustained period of time is if we are clear in our intention and our motivation. And for some people and for some things we need to remind ourselves on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>So when people miss something or forget to do something or decide not to do something, I would always say thereâ€™s a pretty good chance at some level our motivation has changed or slipped or weâ€™ve forgotten what our initial intention was. So I would go back to that intention. What is it? Why am I doing this? What do I want from this? And really kind of examining that hard. Really examine the intention. And if you do, youâ€™re not going to miss it. If you find whatâ€™s behind the action, youâ€™ll follow through on the action.</p>
