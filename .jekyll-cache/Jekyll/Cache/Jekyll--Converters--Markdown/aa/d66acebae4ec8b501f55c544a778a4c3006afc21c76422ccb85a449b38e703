I"<p>One thing you can say about mornings is that theyâ€™re neighborly. When you go for a stroll (and thatâ€™s really the right word for it â€“Â â€œwalkâ€ is inadequate) before the sun hits a 30 degree angle in the sky, you enter a world of dog walkers and peaceful people who are smiling and make eye contact with you. After 9:00 the eye contact stops.</p>

<p>Mornings are by nature a time of welcoming. Hello, world! Welcome back! Itâ€™s like the air is saying hi to you everywhere you go. Everyone and everything has that snoozy blinking freshness of coming to their senses. A bit of disorientation and shock at being brought back to life and discovering the world again.</p>

<p>City noise. Drill. Ship. Car and bridge. Hurry up, scurry up, letâ€™s get on with the day.</p>

<hr />

<p>Coffee is the de facto standard for waking up in the morning. It says, â€œHey! How the heck are ya? Welcome!â€ But when I really want a kick in the pants to get me going, matcha is the drink for me. Matcha doesnâ€™t say anything, it just looks at you and hits you all at once and then youâ€™re up.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, itâ€™s a beautiful day in this neighborhood. Good morning!</p>
