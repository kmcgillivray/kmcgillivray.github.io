I"K<p>Bow before the power of the human voice. The cords that ring with word and song. When the goddess Gaga speaks and all other sounds must be still to hear the truth.</p>

<hr />

<p>I like words. I like to use words as a whip. Sharp, concise, accurate… maybe dangerous. I like to use words as honey, sweetening moments to remove bitter tastes. I like to use words as a potter’s wheel, spinning energy to shape the next moment of emerging reality.</p>

<p>I like to use words to teach—they are my walking stick and sanctuary. I like to use words as a seed, to plant an idea in someone else’s mind.</p>

<p>I like to feel the shape of a sentence. To hold it in my mouth and rearrange its edges before I say it. To round off hard edges, emphasize another area, change its color and tone and music. I like to feel the texture of text. The weaving of the fabric of characters.</p>

<p>And then I like to use those characters to tell computers what to do. Code is text. Code makes the software that eats the world.</p>

<p>The Word made flesh, our code, our human logics, the source of our power.</p>

<p>Vocabulary is magic. Syntax is sublime. If you think words don’t matter you’ve never seen J. K. Rowling wage war with trolls on Twitter. 140 character volleys of grandeur and wit.</p>

<p>Words are powerful. Words make the world go round.</p>
