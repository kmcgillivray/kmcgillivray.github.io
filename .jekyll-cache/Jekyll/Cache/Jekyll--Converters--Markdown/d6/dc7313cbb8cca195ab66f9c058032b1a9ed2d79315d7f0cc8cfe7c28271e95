I"í<p>â€œHey buddy, do you know the way to the Jefferson YMCA?â€</p>

<p>â€œYeah, this is Washington, Jefferson is two streets over that way, back in that corner.â€</p>

<hr />

<p>The mystery of one way streets. Once you go down one itâ€™s hard to go back and find your way again. And if you donâ€™t have the web of roads memorized, itâ€™s almost impossible to give anyone else directions.</p>

<hr />

<p>One of the weirdest feelings in the world is looking at a bar in the morning. The air has the empty, still calm of the morningâ€”a hangover moment that makes you feel like you should be eating breakfast.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the shade, the air is too cold for the number of layers I have on. But in the sun, itâ€™s shockingly calm and peaceful, the perfect temperature for being quiet.</p>

<p>I am a monk of the modern world, walking to the store to get a copy of <em>The New York Times</em>. The streets are a contemplative cloister of concrete and empty benches that afford the chance to rest.</p>
