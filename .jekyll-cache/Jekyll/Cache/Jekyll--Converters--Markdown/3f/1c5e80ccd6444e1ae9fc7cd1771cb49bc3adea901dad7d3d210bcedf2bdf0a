  <p>“I may be exaggerating a little, but I feel like developing a large-scale video game like The Legend of Zelda is similar to setting out on a voyage across the ocean in the distant past… It’s similar to seeking a new continent that no one on Earth has visited before.</p>

  <p>We set out from the harbor without a single sea chart. We start out not knowing what direction we’re heading in, and the small crew argues back and forth about where to go and what to do. Sometimes, we find ourselves adrift. Other times, we’re buffeted by storms and end up becoming shipwrecked. Still others, we cry that we’ve discovered new land, but when we make for shore, we end up at a loss when we find that it was nothing but a tiny, barren island.</p>

  <p>However, we never remain in the same place for long, and as we keep moving forward, we eventually catch sight of the new continent we’ve been seeking just beyond the horizon. The crew gets bigger, and we all band together to make a push for the new world…</p>

  <p>If we manage to make it safely to the opposite shore, then I know that fans around the world will enjoy what we’ve achieved. That’s the greatest gratification of making Zelda.”</p>
