I"‚<p>Imagine this. Youâ€™re sitting in a car, eating lunch. The windows are rolled down. Itâ€™s a little hot outside, probably too hot to really be sitting in your car comfortably, but then thereâ€™s the breeze. Without the breeze, this whole situation would be impossible. The breeze comes, and itâ€™s like, â€œOkay, sitting in this car right now is the greatest thing ever. Man, that feels good.â€</p>

<p data-pullquote="Breeze just breezes. Breezes gonna breeze."></p>

<p>But the breeze isnâ€™t there all the time. It only happens once in a while. You have to wait for the breeze. You canâ€™t make the breeze come, it doesnâ€™t listen to you. Breeze just breezes. Breezes gonna breeze.</p>

<p>Buddha in the breeze.</p>

<p>And then you might have a thought. And the thought goes, â€œHey man, you gotta write something.â€ And of course you donâ€™t know what to write or why this thought is interrupting your nice breeze time.</p>

<p>â€œHey man, you gotta write something. Hope itâ€™s as good as it was yesterday. Remember how great that was? Do that again.â€</p>

<p>Fear is mounting now. You canâ€™t make writing come any more than you can make the breeze come. Or any more than you can force yourself to breathe out infinitely. It just isnâ€™t how the thing works.</p>

<p>So you take a moment and say, â€œHey, letâ€™s just wait for the breeze.â€</p>

<p>And then, finally, out comes the breeze.</p>
