<p>It’s today, Sunday; Spring is breaking through the hard winter exterior and making everything soft and playful. It’s cloudy and calm, four books sit on the window shelf, the last one tipped over.</p>

<p>It’s the Sunday after daylight savings time and everyone wakes up thinking, “Oh, God, what time is it?” Daylight savings is unnatural on a biological level and our bodies don’t trust it. It was invented in the social and intellectual realms, and our bodies, like five-year-olds, say “Okay, I’ll go along with this but I won’t make it easy. I’ll be dragging my feet for a whole week making you feel weird when you wake up every day.”</p>

<p>So yeah, it’s cloudy and calm and beautiful and no one is moving around yet. Books falling over, patio furniture in the balcony freshly brought out from storage. An in-between hour concealed in fog and the floating feeling of new spring.</p>

<p>It’s this feeling, right now, that can only mean that it’s this moment, right now.</p>

<p>Time for brunch.</p>
