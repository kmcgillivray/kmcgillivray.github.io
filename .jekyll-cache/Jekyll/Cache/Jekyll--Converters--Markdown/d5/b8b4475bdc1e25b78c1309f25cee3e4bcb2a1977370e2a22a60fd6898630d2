I"“<p>Imagine this. Youâ€™re sitting in a car, eating lunch. The windows are rolled down. Itâ€™s a little hot outside, probably too hot to really be sitting in your car comfortably, but then thereâ€™s the breeze. Without the breeze, this whole situation would be impossible. The breeze comes, and itâ€™s like, â€œOkay, sitting in this car right now is the greatest thing ever. Man, that feels good.â€</p>
