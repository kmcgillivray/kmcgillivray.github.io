I"÷<p>The car wasnâ€™t working. What a beautiful machine, reduced to helplessness. Panic, alarm, canâ€™t go back to work of course.</p>

<p>Father to the rescue, hallelujah.</p>

<p>â€œOn the farm I had a tractor break down one day,â€ he says. â€œI still had ten acres of baling to do.â€</p>

<p>Puts things in perspective.</p>

<p>â€œI found another tractor with the same kinds of parts. I ripped into it and took out what I needed.â€</p>

<p>I imagine the other tractorâ€™s feelings. What an invasion and a sacrifice, to give some part of yourself like that, even temporarily.</p>

<p>â€œI got the baling done by 8:30. This reminds me of that.â€</p>

<p>A frantic chase for a new battery, punctuated with a reunion with a high school friend from 1973, interactions with three separate Wal-Mart employees (There are two kinds of people in the world, those who ask store clerks for help and those who donâ€™t. Iâ€™m the second one, heâ€™s the first one.), including Eunice whose patience was worthy of admiration, and a number of trips back and forth to the car that I couldnâ€™t count.</p>

<p>â€œThe right tool for the job! It makes all the difference.â€</p>

<p>â€œThis is creative work.â€</p>

<p>Lines from <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> are an appropriate accompaniment to this event.</p>

<p>Pay attention to quality. Maintenance requires great peace of mind. Quality is achieved when the mind and the machine are at rest. If youâ€™re not careful, youâ€™ll work your own problems right into the machine.</p>

<p>â€œThanks for coming, Dad.â€</p>

<p>â€œWell, I was just finishing up work and was getting ready for my flute labyrinth walk tonight and about to take a nap, but Iâ€™d rather be here with you anywayâ€¦ you know?â€</p>

<p>Thanks, Dad.</p>
