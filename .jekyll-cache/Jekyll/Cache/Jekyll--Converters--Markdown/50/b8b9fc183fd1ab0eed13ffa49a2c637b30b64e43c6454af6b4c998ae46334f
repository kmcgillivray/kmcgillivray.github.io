I"«<p>The more I learn about the creative process, the more I realize one thing about it is true: for everything that you can say about creativity, the opposite is also true.</p>

<p>When it comes to the creative process, Iâ€™ve been trying to â€œfigure it outâ€ for a long time. Iâ€™ll read something or experience something and think, â€œOh! So <em>thatâ€™s</em> how it works.â€ But then I read something else or experience something that contradicts what I just learned and I have to start over again.</p>

<p>Creativity doesnâ€™t fit into the world of either/or, this or that. By nature it is contradictory and paradoxical, and thatâ€™s why it works the way it does. I think there are some guiding principles that can get you started, and some common, even universal, challenges that get in the way of creativity. But at a certain point, the rules break down and all you can do is stay alert, keep moving, and hold on for the ride.</p>
