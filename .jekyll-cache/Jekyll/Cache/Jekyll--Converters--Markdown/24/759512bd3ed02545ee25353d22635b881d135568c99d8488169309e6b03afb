I"·<p>The apartment building I live in is under construction. Do you think I could wear a sign that says ‚Äúunder construction‚Äù just to remind everyone that I‚Äôm not perfect and I‚Äôm just trying to figure everything out and I‚Äôm sorry for my dust?</p>

<hr />

<p>On my windowsill is a terrarium of succulents that Alex made. Have you ever noticed the quietness of still things? The way they almost breathe if you look at them for long enough? They must be the most patient things on the planet to sit there all day waiting for someone to notice them.</p>

<hr />

<p>My phone battery is at 10%. Have you ever tried to finish writing a blog post before your battery died? It really puts things in perspective. Get what you need to get done before the end. Which end? Will we ever not be under construction?</p>

<p>That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs better to make it, send it out, let it go. Move on to the next thing. Everything is always under construction anyway so make it in an hour and be done.</p>
