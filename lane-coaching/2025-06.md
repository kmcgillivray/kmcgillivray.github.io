# Kevin's Coaching Page | June 2025

Hi again, Lane! Thank you again for your awesome feedback from my [first message](../2025-05). I've been unpacking, and practicing it since then, particularly your note about connecting areas of interest as a whole rather than leaving them isolated. I feel like it's had a truly transformative impact on what I see when I'm drawing and I can personally see a significant difference in my drawings before and after your advice.

I wanted to share some of the drawings I've made since then, and also ask about a couple new areas for feedback.

## Current goals

I shared my goals last time but I thought I would just recap and write a bit about how I think they're going:

* **Improve composition, shape design, and atmosphere in figures and portraits** – I suppose this is just an eternal goal! I think I'd like to explore this even more and experiment with pushing in different stylistic directions (like the low resolution drawings you shared recently).
* **Develop more confidence and fluency in physical charcoal** - I think this is happening as a result of just spending more time on paper rather than the tablet, and I've benefited from setting up a nicer tilted drawing desk area at home that is more comfortable than an easel.
* **Create more developed and intentional collections of portraits and figures in charcoal / sanguine / oil** – I think this is going well, will share drawings below!
* **Learn new ideas to support my own students and the life drawing sessions I host** – Learning a ton from your feedback and Patreon posts!

## Challenges

* I'm struggling a bit with simplifying portraits as a component of a figure drawing! I admire how you've mentioned you often spend a long time on the portrait in a figure drawing and how it brings the figure together, and I'm looking to practice that more. Will share some examples below.
* I find my portrait drawings in general tend to be a bit hit and miss. My theory is I tend to rely slightly too much on intuition and visual observation and I feel the results are better when I remember to give myself more structural underdrawing. But I'm curious for a fresh perspective and advice!

## Drawings

### Sanguine studies

I've been making studies using a sanguine stick that's similar to a compressed charcoal stick. I tend to take my time with these, maybe 40-60 minutes, and I've been focusing on both of your points of feedback related to connecting disjointed areas and creating long gestures. I'd say this is taking a "Steve Huston" approach with a lot of material laid on the page and heavy blending into the paper grain. I'm quite pleased with these and I'm curious for your general feedback! I haven't spent a lot of time studying the structure of knee joints and muscles, so I'm guessing there are some anatomy improvements I could make.

### Portraits, big and small

I've been drawing a few portraits to practice connecting areas of interest, as well as practicing small, simplified portraits that could be a component of a figure drawing. As I mentioned, I find a pretty variable success rate with portraits lately. Looking for feedback on portraits in general and any tips related to portraits as part of a figure!

### Gestures

I think I made a small breakthrough in my short post gesture drawings, integrating your feedback and revisiting a few sections of Henry Yan's book. Just sharing a few random samples from the last few weeks, mostly 2 min. gestures and a longer study.

I was lucky enough to find this [out of print Sargent book](https://www.amazon.com/John-Singer-Sargent-Male-Nudes/dp/0789302616) at the local library! Was great to see your thoughts on the show at the Met, I hoped to make a trip out myself but not sure I will make it.' %}

## Thank you!!

Thanks again, Lane! Looking forward to your feedback and hope you're having a great summer.
