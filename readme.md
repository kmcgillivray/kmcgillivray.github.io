This is the repository for my [personal site](https://kevinmcgillivray.net). It's built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Netlify](http://netlify.com).

## Getting started

*New to Git or programming in general?* To use this project, you'll need to know how to use the command line and Git. If you want to get up to speed on those, read about the [command line](http://kevinmcgillivray.net/introduction-to-text-editors-and-the-command-line/), and [try Git](http://try.github.io). Then install [Atom](http://atom.io) or another text editor if you don't have one. Then, follow the directions below.

To run this project locally, you'll need to install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) first, which means you'll need a Ruby environment set up on your computer. That can be tricky the first time, so you may need to do some research for a good tutorial.

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory on the command line.
3. Run `jekyll serve`
4. Go to `http://localhost:4000` to see the site.

## Deployment

To update the live site, push changes to the `master` branch – the site will automatically deploy to [Netlify](http://netlify.com).
