<!-- Thank you for stopping by the gallery! I hope these paintings find a good home with you.

**To reserve a painting, please send me an email using the link below each image.** US shipping will be between $10<sup>.00</sup> to $20<sup>.00</sup> depending on the painting size. International shipping will vary by location. All paintings will be framed. Please allow 6-8 weeks to shipâ€”I hope to ship sooner, but with supply chain delays I may have challenges gathering materials and preparing paintings for shipping. This is also my first art sale so I expect to hit a few snags!
