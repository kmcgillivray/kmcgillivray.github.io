Recently I've been using [Github](http://www.github.com/kmcgillivray/resume) to update my resume. Using Github as a writing tool is something that I've seen a few other people do, and I was curious to try it myself.

Something I didn't expect was that you can see the creative process being tracked through commits. They alternate... writing, editing, writing, more writings, editings. I can see the pendulum as it swings between generating raw material and refining that material. And it's awesome.
