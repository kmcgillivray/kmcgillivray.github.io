You never know what roads you'll walk down twice. Do we move down the road, or do we stand still and the moments and places come to us?

"I should have brought avocados with me!"

Four people sip coffee on the front porch. The James remains in the slumber room.

The gravel parking area in front of the cabin is a landscape of peaceâ€”each piece of rock celebrating quiet and sun. They stay still, but don't they experience just as much as us? People coming and going every day, each moment a different quality of sunlight. Every moment is a new adventure whether you're staying still or not.

My goal for the weekend (if you're allowed to have goals in vacation world) is to be as still as possible, even if I'm moving around. To view myself as the still point and meet the world in each moment.

As Lady Gaga says, to enjoy the gift of life, to do that and nothing else.

"I'm going to have another cup of coffee."

"Yeah, I'm about to have another one too."

"Can I read that when you're done, lady?"

I sit cross-legged in the chair, trying to be the [buddha in the breeze](/making-is-breathing). But I think I'm more like the gravel in the driveway, seeing the whole world by standing still.

"Look around, look around, how lucky we are to be alive right now."

This is our [second visit](/crossroads) to the Crossroads Motel.
