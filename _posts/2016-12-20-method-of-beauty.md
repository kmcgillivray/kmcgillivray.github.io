description: "But music comes whether called or not"
---

What I thought was foolishness was music.  
What I thought was a mind in chaos was a mind at play.  
What I thought I needed to find outside was inside all along.  
What I thought I could control was the thing that needed to be free.  
Illusions of a mind hungry to know the truth and tame it to its will.

But music comes whether called or notâ€”You are a function of the world, Taking input, producing output. You are a method of beauty. You are an instance of the pattern making new reality from perception. The pattern of standing around and accidentally writing a song.
