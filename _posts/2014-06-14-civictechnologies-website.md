#CIVICTechnologies Website

CIVICTechnologies makes software that helps libraries connect with their communities and provide better services and resources to their patrons. I designed and developed their website and also guided the visual style of the demo of one of their products, CommunityConnect.

I enjoyed working on this project because it was a collaborative effort focused on a flexible, iterative design process.

Working on the online demo for CommunityConnect was a great learning experience for me because it gave me a taste of product design.
