title: Thoughts on Care and Quality from Jony Ive and Marc Newson
category: writing

> "Part of the human condition is that we sense care."

> "The only way you can make something great is to care to an extraordinary level."

In the wake of big Apple news this week and the announcement that Jony Ive's friend and collaborator [Marc Newson](http://www.marc-newson.com/AboutBiography.aspx?GroupSelected=2&Category=Biography) would be joining Apple as a designer, this video of a conversation they had with Charlie Rose started making the rounds.

They cover a wide range of important ideas about creativity and design including the difference between aesthetic simplicity and purposeful simplicity, the strange culture of anonymity that accompanies design work, and the role of personal taste and aesthetic response. The main theme of the conversation however is the role of care in creating high quality work. It's also a celebration of the kind of friendship in which collaboration is inevitable.

Mix with some of my favorite quotes from *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*:

> "If you really don't care you aren't going to know it's wrong. The act of pronouncing it wrong's a form of caring."

> "A person who sees Quality and feels it as he works is a person who cares. A person who cares about what he sees and does is a person who's bound to have some characteristics of Quality."

> "The difference between a good mechanic and a bad one is this ability to select the good facts from the bad ones on the basis of quality. He has to care!"
