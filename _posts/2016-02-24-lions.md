On either side of my TV are two lions. Kings of the pride, dignified. Defending the portal of my entertainment like they own the place.

Beautiful sculptures, capturing a feeling of life in aesthetics. Replicas of the ones outside the Art Institute of Chicago. Cultural cats. Alex calls them "Felix" and "Olaf".

How did Daniel feel in that lion's den? Can I even imagine? When you commune with cats, is there a part of you that doesn't go a little wild?
