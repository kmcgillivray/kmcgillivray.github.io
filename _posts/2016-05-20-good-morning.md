One thing you can say about mornings is that they're neighborly. When you go for a stroll (and that's really the right word for it – “walk” is inadequate) before the sun hits a 30 degree angle in the sky, you enter a world of dog walkers and peaceful people who are smiling and make eye contact with you. After 9:00 the eye contact stops.

Mornings are by nature a time of welcoming. Hello, world! Welcome back! It's like the air is saying hi to you everywhere you go. Everyone and everything has that snoozy blinking freshness of coming to their senses. A bit of disorientation and shock at being brought back to life and discovering the world again.

City noise. Drill. Ship. Car and bridge. Hurry up, scurry up, let's get on with the day.

Coffee is the de facto standard for waking up in the morning. It says, "Hey! How the heck are ya? Welcome!" But when I really want a kick in the pants to get me going, matcha is the drink for me. Matcha doesn't say anything, it just looks at you and hits you all at once and then you're up.

Well, it's a beautiful day in this neighborhood. Good morning!
