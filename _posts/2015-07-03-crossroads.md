I'm in the kind of motel where they hang a fly swatter on the wall because there's a good chance you'll need it. Alex is wearing the kind of outfit you wear on vacation, especially the hat. I wear my normal clothes because I'm not sure vacations require much thought about outfits but obviously they do. You can't just wear your normal clothes, you have to look like you're on vacation.

"Do you know where the cabin is? Over there, to the left. It's *not* the one with the teepees in front of it."

Foster says that Wisconsin is the best place to be for the Fourth of July. I have to agree. Nothing is more in-between metropolitan and rural, more a mix of America.

James refuses to not shower. Everyone is pissed.

"Who cares what you look like in Montello?!"

He replies, "Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate."

"We're walking down to Ed and Laura's. Cabin 17. Think you can find it?"

"Don't leave me!"

"It's the one without teepees."

"Without what?"

"Teepees."

An old man sits outside the motel office. We leave our room and he greets us, "Good morning."

This is the kind of place where people greet you from 75 feet away. The greeting radius is wider here.

This is our first night in the Crossroads Motel.
