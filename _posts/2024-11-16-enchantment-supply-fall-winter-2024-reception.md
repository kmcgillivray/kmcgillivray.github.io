Last week we had a reception for my first solo art show, [Enchantment Supply Fall Winter 2024](https://enchantment.supply/exhibit/)! I’m feeling truly enchanted and overwhelmingly welcomed and encouraged by the friends, family, and comrades that have supported the show and were able to share a night of conversations about art, trees, and magic.

We moved to Appleton just over a year ago and have enjoyed discovering everything happening in the vibrant local art community. The main reason I wanted to host an art show was to have a chance to get to know our new neighbors better, and that’s exactly what happened. I was grateful to see many new friends from [Appleton Drawing Club](https://appletondrawingclub.com/), and reconnect with old friends and other local artists.

Among the many highlights of the night:

* I learned the location of a magical willow tree in my neighborhood that I now have a quest to find and make some art about
* Tree Club was founded
* Plans were made for a punny D&D game villain known as Cursive Straw (aka Curse of Strahd), a vampire who drinks blood out of a crazy straw
* Many ideas for new life drawing sessions were shared
* Stories of the Green Man were told over candlelight
* I learned about the incredible range of projects everyone is working on in writing, illustration, painting, drawing, furniture making, dancing
* A toddler received an enchanted pine cone

I’m grateful to everyone who attended the reception and helped to make it a reality. Alex made the night especially magical as Chief Vibe Architect with lighting, refreshments, and calligraphy for all of the art. The Coffee Wizardz crew has been remarkably supportive and kind in sharing their time and space for the show. And you’ve all made me feel right at home in our neighborhood. I loved every step of putting this show together and I already can’t wait for the next one!
