I love you high and low  
I love you weak and strong  
I love you Regina and Alexander, John and Paul

I love you sun and moon  
I love you river and wave  
I love you rain and rain and rain and rain

I love you umbrella and sunglasses  
I love you boots and sandals  
I love you coat and jacket and scarves and shoe

I love you here and there  
I love you now and then  
I love you always, all times, beginning to end

I love you heat and cold  
I love you whiskey and wine  
I love you beer and tea, still water and sparkle

I love you quiet and loud  
I love you smart and proud  
I love you wise and kind and beauty and now

I love you book and newspaper  
I love you word and song  
I love you whole and part, mind and heart

I love you sight and sound  
I love you touch and laugh  
I love you always, all times, beginning to end
