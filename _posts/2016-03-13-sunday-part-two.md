It's today, Sunday; Spring is breaking through the hard winter exterior and making everything soft and playful. It's cloudy and calm, four books sit on the window shelf, the last one tipped over.

It's the Sunday after daylight savings time and everyone wakes up thinking, "Oh, God, what time is it?" Daylight savings is unnatural on a biological level and our bodies don't trust it. It was invented in the social and intellectual realms, and our bodies, like five-year-olds, say "Okay, I'll go along with this but I won't make it easy. I'll be dragging my feet for a whole week making you feel weird when you wake up every day."

So yeah, it's cloudy and calm and beautiful and no one is moving around yet. Books falling over, patio furniture in the balcony freshly brought out from storage. An in-between hour concealed in fog and the floating feeling of new spring.

It's this feeling, right now, that can only mean that it's this moment, right now.

Time for brunch.
