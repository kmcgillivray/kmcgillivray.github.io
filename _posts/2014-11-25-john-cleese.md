Quick announcement: Starting this week I am officially starting as a [mentor](http://bloc.io/mentors/kevin-mcgillivray) for the frontend web development course at [Bloc](http://www.bloc.io). I'm excited to try this new thing—I've been wanting to get back into a teaching/mentoring position for a long time.

Here are some of my favorite things I've learned about the Bloc course so far:

* The course is based on a one-to-one model. I like the idea of being able to tailor the course to each student.
* It's focused on practicing good creative habits, learning habits, and developer habits, not just syntax and step-by-step tutorials.
* There are a whole bunch of cool tools and resources besides the main course that students can use to learn more, get questions answered, etc. It's a cool system.

I may post here more about it as I get started, but for now, wish me luck.

## Other bits

I'm [reading/have recently read](/librarie)... London in Paint (<3), Ready Player One (omg), and The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying.

Can't stop reading Ready Player One right now. London in Paint is a cool collection of paintings of London from the collection at the Museum of London. And the Life-Changing Magic of Tidying is a book about... well, tidying. Getting all of your stuff organized and in order. It's by Marie Kondo. Her main point is to only keep things in your life that bring you joy. I started following her advice, working through the things I own, and it's been a completely new way to think about decluttering. It feels very positive and affirming, rather than being a stressful experience with lots of frustration and pressure to get rid of as much as possible. Opening my closet makes me so happy right now. I definitely recommend it if you're curious about decluttering and sometimes forget how to do it, like me.

I'm also working on some other projects, but I'll share more about those another time. See you later!
