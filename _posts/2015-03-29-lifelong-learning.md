After graduation from college, I experienced a dizzying shift in context. To say that I felt like a bird finally leaping from the nest would be an accurate cliché.

I left the warm support of professors and a close-knit community of peers. The rich resources of the college campus. The nutrients of scholarly words in the air, the environment of random coincidences that lead to new ideas and understanding.

I realized that a lot of people put a lot of work into creating that environment, and that I had invested heavily in the lucky opportunity to be there with *tuition*. And now that wasn't accessible.

It felt like something was missing. I was looking for something I lost. And I knew that when I found it, it wouldn't look the same as it did before. But it was out there.

I had to figure out how to build my own nest.

I know an old master. My painting teacher John Gordon. It feels strange to call him an old master because he is certainly a master, but he doesn't fit the description of "old." His energy is neither old nor young, but simply strong, sharp, and clear. A conversation with him is a brisk jog for the mind.

The hunger and searching feeling led me to a realization. I quickly realized that the best thing college taught me wasn't any specific topic or field but the learning *habit*, almost to the point of a compulsive addiction to learning. Habits need to be learned over a long period of time, and college was that opportunity to grow the habit. The goal of college is to develop expertise in a chosen field, but it's also to guide the student toward being an independent, lifelong learner. After graduation, without the support of teachers or the requirements of a class, I still found myself wanting to explore new ideas and learn because that's what I was used to doing all the time.

And yet without that support, we have to relearn how to learn. Without the resources and structures of the college environment, we have to create our own learning environment and integrate it into our lives. It's up to us to build our libraries, invite our friends for discussions, seek new influences. To create the environment where learning is natural. There is a great danger that we will lose the gift of the learning muscle if we don't create an environment that encourages us to exercise it.

I know another old master. My grandfather. At the age of 87 he made the switch from a Windows laptop to a Macbook Air and iPad. He posts pictures to Facebook from his Macbook which is synced with his iPad using photo stream.

There’s a widely held but subtle belief that learning is meant for a certain period of your life and that the rest of your life is meant for applying that learning to your work. Of course you learn new things related to your job all the time, but other learning that isn’t specifically job related is often seen as a waste of time or unnecessary.

A lot of people don't like school. It's almost taboo as an adult to get into academically toned discussions.

These are subtle beliefs that can change how we think about learning and approach it after college. The danger in this perspective is that it can lead to an education that stops at a certain age, when the truth is that education is something that should continue and grow no matter what age you are. Learning is not just something you can do when you have permission to do it. It's an essential part of a long, healthy, creative life.

I know two more masters of lifelong learning. My parents. Growing up my house was a library. My mom, always reading something new, always learning and changing. My dad, picking up a flute as a midlife crisis/calling and playing his way into the blissful rapture of an unending well of enthusiasm. Mastering the art of life.

## Strategies for lifelong learning

So I've been trying to figure out what learning looks like away from that supportive environment and how to continue my education as a graduate.

Now for the practical side of this. So how do we keep learning for a whole lifetime? If it's our responsibility to build learning into our lives, then how do we create that environment? I'm experimenting with this and I don't have any easy answers, but here are a few things I've been doing.

Since graduation I’ve experimented with ways to continue to intregrate self-directed learning into my life. Here are a few of the things I've tried that have worked for me. Some of them are pretty obvious, but we have to start somewhere.

1. Watching lectures online—This is one of my favorite ways to encourage continuing education. Pretty much every college or university in the world has some sort of online lecture series. It simulates the experience of sitting in a classroom and being introduced to unexpected ideas. I particularly like series like the [UCL Lunch Hour Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3pa6ekyhtl2rdDzsF3JtJse37djBe2MF) that have lectures from a variety of different fields so you can get a mix of ideas but also have organized playlists focused on specific fields.
2. Going to conferences—If you look around, you're likely to find conferences in your area where people gather together to share and discuss ideas. Conferences like [BarCamp] are particularly beneficial because they are participant led and organized. You can get a huge variety of topics and easily share your own interests if you want to.
3. Going to museums.
4. Reading (and other media)–Reading books is one of the best ways to explore new ideas, of course. But I also include movies, videos, podcasts, music, articles, video games, and art in my reading list.
5. Writing—I think this is one of the most important ones. Reading is great, but writing is equally important because it gives you a chance to review, reflect, and refine your understanding. It also helps you formulate your own perspective and make connections between different ideas that may not be discovered if you're not given the chance to talk it out.
6. Organizing learning into "courses"—In an effort to be a little more systematic and less chaotic in my exploration, I've tried to identify key themes as they come up. The process tends to go like this: I read, watch lectures, go to museums as usual, but as I do so I try to look for common themes or threads that connect the different things I'm exploring. Once something becomes clear, I'll make a note of it, and even give it a fake "course" name. For example... If I have a name for it I'll be more likely to remember it and be able to find books and other resources on the same topic. It's like exploring a huge map, and then identifying a smaller portion of the map to explore in more detail.

If you have any thoughts about lifelong learning or can point me to any other good resources about it, please [tweet me](http://twitter.com/kev_mcg). I would enjoy talking about it with you.

I graduated from college a few years ago and since then I’ve thought a lot about how to continue learning outside of college. I love school, I love learning, and I miss a lot of the structures and systems that college provides to support learning.
