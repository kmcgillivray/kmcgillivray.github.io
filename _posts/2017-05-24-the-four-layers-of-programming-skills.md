Hi there! This is a post I've been meaning to write for a long time and decided to record it as a video instead. In the video I talk about the four layers of skills that you need to learn when you're learning how to write code and how to explore each one. These layers are:

1. **Syntax skills** – how to read and write a programming language and the core concepts behind how the language works.
2. **Programmatic thinking skills** – how to think like a computer and translate a process into a specific set of instructions that a computer can understand.
3. **Creative skills** – how to figure out an answer when it's not obvious what it should be, how to go from a rough draft to a final draft with all the bumps and detours in between.
4. **Interdisciplinary skills** – understanding and borrowing from other fields to enrich our own programming practice and the things we make.
