## Build your skills, career, and creativity with a one-on-one mentorship

### Build a super strong foundation

Go beyond syntax and learn essential principles of programatic thinking and web development you can use in any project.

### Connect with a community

Connect with other students and professional developers at monthly group studio sessions.

### Learn for mastery

Get direct, detailed feedback and guidance as you learn at your own pace. Learn for mastery, not speed.

### Explore wide, dig deep

Connect your skills to a range of interesting topics in the history of the web and computer science and additional interdisciplinary topics to deepen your education.
