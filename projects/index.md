# Projects

## Promotional Websites

## [Insight Creative](http://insightcreative.com)

Insight Creative is an advertising agency. I had a great time working on this site with my colleagues there. It's built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and served from GitHub Pages.

## [CIVICTechnologies](http://civictechnologies.com)

CIVICTechnologies helps libraries connect with their communities using strategic planning services and software products. I created this promotional website for them which also features an interactive demo.

## [BuildYourOwnCurriculum](http://insightcreative.info/byoc) 

BuildYourOwnCurriculum is a web application that helps teachers and school districts plan their curriculum, compare it to state and federal standards, and manage classroom activities. This is a work-in-progress promotional site for a major new update to the software.

## Open Source

## [typography.css](http://github.com/kmcgillivray/typography.css)

I found myself setting up a lot of typographic styles over and over again in every site I worked on, so I separated them into their own template to share with other developers and make my process a bit smoother.

## [Base Theme](http://github.com/kmcgillivray/base-theme)

I also found myself repeating many of the same tasks when setting up new Jekyll sites, so I set up a simple-as-possible base theme to use to make getting started with a new Jekyll site even easier.
