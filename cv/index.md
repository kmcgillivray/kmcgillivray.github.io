## Objective
{: .mt0 .ttu .tracked .f5 .b}

In everything I do, my goal is to explore and practice creativity and share what I learn through teaching, writing, and other projects.

As a designer and developer, my work is focused on building creative, mindful, and healthy communities online and offline and celebrating the history, creativity, and potential of the web.

As a teacher, I believe that creativity is a skill that can be learned, practiced, and taught, and I emphasize the interdisciplinary creative skills that are valuable in every career and discipline.

I am currently looking for more opportunities to continue this exploration of creativity, community, and code, and to make deeper contributions to the innovation of education in creativity and technology.

## Professional Experience
{: .mt0 .ttu .tracked .f5 .b}

**Sandcastle**
{: .mb0 .mt4 }

Partner, Lead Developer, 2016 - present
{: .f6 }

Sandcastle is a web design studio focused on education, community building, and independent creative businesses and organizations. My partner, Foster, and I started Sandcastle as a way to support the success of projects we care about that make a positive difference in our communities. Our clients range from cultural and educational organizations to local creative businesses and independent creative professionals.

**Code Convoy**  
{: .mb0 .mt4 }

Co-founder, Head of Curriculum and Mentorship, 2016 - present
{: .f6 }

Code Convoy is a collaboration between Sandcastle, other local businesses and organizations, and local developers to provide a high quality learning and training resource for learners looking to study web development. Code Convoy started as a one-day workshop and has grown into a regular small group class. I serve as the lead instructor and develop the core curriculum for these classes. My goal with this project is to build a pathway for training to support students and the local economy, provide a high quality lifelong learning environment, and experiment with new approaches to teaching design and programming.

**Bloc**
{: .mb0 .mt4 }

Frontend Web Development Mentor, 2015 - present
{: .f6 }

As a mentor at Bloc, I've provided one-on-one support, guidance, and training to over fifty students as they completed an intensive, bootcamp-style web development course. In the course, students build their skills from beginner to advanced through a series of lessons, exercises, and projects. As they progress, I make sure they are gaining the necessary skills to be a developer, help them explore career options related to their interests, and provide encouragement and inspiration throughout their learning journey.

**Insight Creative**
{: .mb0 .mt4 }

Graphic Designer/Web Developer, 2012 - 2015
{: .f6 }

At Insight, I designed and produced websites, print materials, visual identities, photography, and audio projects. In my role, I increased the efficiency, collaboration, and quality of work across the design and development team by providing training and guidance on iterative development practices and development tools and methodologies like Git, responsive design, and modern deployment workflows.

**St. Norbert College Writing Center**
{: .mb0 .mt4 }

Writing Consultant/Graphic Designer, 2011 - 2012
{: .f6 }

As a writing consultant, I provided mentorship, feedback, and training to students about their writing, and in the process encouraged the development of their creative and communication skills. I also initiated and maintained a social media strategy and visual identity for the writing center.
