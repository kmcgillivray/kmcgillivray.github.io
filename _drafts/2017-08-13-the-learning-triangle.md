As I explored in [a previous post](/the-four-layers-of-programming-skills/), I see learning programming as four layers of skills:

1. **Syntax skills and programming concepts** – how to read and write a programming language and the core concepts behind how the language works.
2. **Programmatic thinking skills** – how to think like a computer and translate a process into a specific set of instructions that a computer can understand.
3. **Creative skills** – how to figure out an answer when it's not obvious what it should be, how to go from a rough draft to a final draft with all the bumps and detours in between.
4. **Interdisciplinary skills** – understanding and borrowing from other fields to enrich our own programming practice and the things we make.

When learning how to code, the go-to approach for learning resource is the venerable tutorial: a hands-on, step-by-step guided experience intended to introduce and illustrate skills and concepts. The programming tutorial is an essential and effective part of learning how to code. Generations of developers have used them and gained skills and experience along the way.

Tutorials are powerful resources for introducing the first layer of programming skills, syntax skills and programming concepts. They're especially great for showing how those concepts work together in a complete, well-organized system. They also provide some examples of programmatic thinking in action, which may help students learn those skills.

However, tutorials are not a good resource for learning the third layer, creative skills. The ability to write code from scratch requires a specific skillset, and step-by-step tutorials don't provide an opportunity to practice that skillset. The majority of tutorials demonstrate pre-written high quality solutions, not the messy, creative, Google-search filled process of writing code to accomplish a specific task when you don't have a solution provided for you.

Tutorials are also not great at _reinforcing_ skills. They are designed to introduce a new skill or concept and provide an initial practice experience, not to provide opportunities to repeat that skill or concept over and over in different contexts until it sticks, which is an important step in the learning process.

This can create a frustrating experience for new developers—because tutorials are relied upon heavily, it's tempting to think that once you've completed a tutorial, you should have everything you need to start building things. And for teachers, it can be tempting to think that if you give a student a tutorial, that should be enough for them to have learned what they need to learn. But tutorials don't necessarily cover the entire range of skills needed to be a developer. Students need resources that can provide practice in all four layers of programming skills. Tutorials are an essential part of that, but the tools we use to teach programming need to expand and deepen to support all skill areas.

A well-balanced learning approach might include experiences that can be categorized as **lessons, exercises, and projects**:

1. **Lessons** – Designed to introduce new material for the first time through demonstration or interactive exploration (see [Explorable Explanations](http://explorabl.es)). A tutorial is an example of one type of lesson.
2. **Exercises** – Designed to reinforce specific bite-sized skills or concepts in a quick, focused way. Exercises are repeatable, numerous, and often grouped into sets of increasing difficulty or complexity.
3. **Projects** – A student-guided experience focused on higher level skill and concept reinforcement as well as practicing the creative skills involved in writing code independently.

In this approach, tutorials are used as lessons that introduce new material, but they are supported by exercise sets and independent projects to round out and integrate all of the skills needed. The quality and format of tutorials themselves can also be improved to demonstrate programmatic thinking and creative skills rather than focusing on syntax and programming concepts.

In future posts I'll explore each of these categories and what characteristics make for high quality lessons, exercises, and projects. Stay tuned!

## The newsletter

I'm just starting a new email newsletter exploring the same topics as this post—better ways to learn and teach programming skills, the essential metaskills and mindset beyond syntax, and code as a creative practice. I'd like to invite you to join me there! In each email I'll let you know about new posts here, as well as explore further ideas related to learning and teaching code. It'll be short, interesting, and encouraging for learners and teachers! Sign up here:
