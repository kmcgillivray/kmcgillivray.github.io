We just finished up a major project at my agency, a new website for our company. You can see the website here: [insightcreative.com](http://insightcreative.com)

In my experience, designing for yourself is a uniquely difficult task compared to designing for a client. I think it's hard to get a clear perspective on the project and hard to decide what to do because you're so close to it. This project had those difficulties, but it was also very fun to work on, and I'm very happy with the result. 

I have some theories about why this project was so enjoyable to work on, and a few thoughts on what I learned from it, so here they are.

# Collaboration is cool

In the past, projects within the web development team at Insight have been pretty solitary. Usually only one developer would be really familiar with a project and there was no easy way to share our code and work together. When someone needed to update a site that another developer had built, things would get very confusing because files would get out of sync and we didn't have a shared understanding of the site's code.

For this project, we focused on collaboration. We had impromptu feedback and dicussion sessions almost every day. This kept the design process focused on team conversation rather than just one developer presenting to everyone else. It also meant that ideas were strengthened because of the regular feedback.

On the technical side, we also used this project to integrate Git and [Github](http://github.com) into our process so that we could share the site's code with each other and all be familiar with it and work on it simultaneously. This alone transformed our process from being almost purely individual to being easy to collaborate.

Overall, this collaboration made the process exciting and energetic. Everyone could jump in and be a part of it, and we all felt like we were working toward a goal together.

# Flexibility is fun

One of my main goals at the beginning of the project was to work in a way that was flexible. I wanted to be able to change things easily, keep things simple so that as we came up with new ideas we could try them out without wasting time. This efficiency is essential to keeping a project moving and enjoyable.

# Make the real thing, don't talk in hypotheticals. Make a decision and move on.

Photoshop mockups are no more. It's important to feel a real model.
