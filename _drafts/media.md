# The problem with media and identity

A theory for why old school is always better than new school, and why gamers are at war.

There are two main issues:

1. The tendency to equate a person with their work. "I hate Justin Bieber."
2. The tendency to think that when experiencing media for a certain audience, that media is insinuating that you are a member of that audience. The media challenges your identity, and so you defend it.

People say "I hate Justin Bieber" when they really mean "I don't like the music that Justin Bieber and his producers have made because it doesn't match my core values, beliefs, and perspective of the world."

This music is meant for middle school girls. When I listen to it, it feels like it's saying that *I'm* a middle school girl. I don't want to be associated with immaturity, femininity, and physical attraction to teenage boys, so I will express my hate for this in order to confirm my identity.

The media we experience and enjoy are flags of identity.
