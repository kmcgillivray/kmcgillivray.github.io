"Take a look at this assignment and create a solution."

"Our client requested this, letâ€™s open a project and do it."

"The website is down, can you fix it?"

This is what a reactive environment looks like.

A proactive environment has two main questions: What should we do now? Why should we do it?

Figuring out what to do is an important step, it only comes up in a proactive environment, and it requires a completely different set of skills, perspectives and priorities.
