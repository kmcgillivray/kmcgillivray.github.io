# About this site

This site is a bit of an experiment. I post one thing at a time on the home page, and once something new is posted the old one is removed and is not archived on the site.

Topics are likely to revolve around the creative process, design, art, music, web development, and other things that I'm interested in.

# About me

I make websites, drawings, paintings and lots of other things. I like simplicity, books, chess, tea, and trying to figure out how creativity works. My favorite word is "studio."
