# About 

My name is Kevin McGillivray. I'm a designer from Wisconsin. I like iterative creativity, simplicity, and tea. My favorite word is "studio."

On this site, I post one piece of writing at a time. Once I post a new post, the old one is removed and is not archived in any way. I keep no copies of it. This is an experiment. It could be fun?
