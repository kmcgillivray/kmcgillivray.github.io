##### Hi, I'm Kevin. I'm a teacher, designer, and web developer.

More than anything I love learning about and practicing creativity and sharing what I learn through teaching, writing, and other projects. I'm the co-founder of [Sandcastle](http://sandcastle.co), a web and game development studio. I'm also a mentor in the frontend web development course at [Bloc](http://bloc.io) and co-founder and instructor at [Code Convoy](http://codeconvoy.com). I like books, chess, tea, podcasts, and mindfulness. My favorite word is "studio."

# This blog will self-destruct in...

I experiment quite a bit on this site, changing its focus and content regularly. I [write](/), share [drawings and paintings](/sketchbook), and do [weird](http://sandcastle.co/kirby/) web development [experiments](/stats).

This site is made with deep affection for the tools used to make it: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Github](http://github.com), [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and [Atom](https://atom.io).
