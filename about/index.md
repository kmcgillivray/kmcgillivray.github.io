##### Hi, I'm Kevin. I'm a teacher, web developer, and tea enthusiast.

More than anything I love learning about and practicing creativity and sharing what I learn through teaching, writing, and other projects. I'm the co-founder of [Sandcastle](http://sandcastle.co), a web and game development studio. I'm also co-founder and instructor at [Code Convoy](http://codeconvoy.com) and a mentor in the frontend web development course at [Bloc](http://bloc.io). I like books, chess, tea, painting, podcasts, and mindfulness. My favorite word is "studio."

# Education

Education is something I care about deeply. I'm grateful for and lucky to have had the opportunity to learn from a huge number of great teachers, not only teachers in school, but in my family, at work, and in my friendships.

Growing up, whenever I started to have questions about a new curiosity, my parents would pull a book off their shelf on that exact topic. Looking back, I can see that I was following in the footsteps of their educational exploration, following paths that many have walked before, and making new discoveries on my own. In school, I admired my teachers—their enthusiasm, the way they introduced me to new ideas in inspiring and interesting ways, the way they dedicated themselves to the personal development and fulfillment of each student, and held us to high standards of thinking, expression, and personal responsibility.

Teaching is something I need to do in order to feel grounded—in 2015 I was working as a web developer and graphic designer, and although I enjoyed the work I was doing and the people I was working with, I had a sense that the work I was doing was missing something important. I have always been a teacher in some way, from teaching piano lessons, helping students at my college's writing center, or mentoring younger students, but from 2013 - 2015 I wasn't actively teaching. I realized that I'm happiest when I'm both teaching—helping other people develop and explore their personal understanding and creative skills–and making things—practicing and applying my own creative skills.

I began looking for opportunities to start teaching in my daily work, and eventually found the opportunity to be a mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io), an online technology bootcamp. I also organized a small web development class in Green Bay, [Code Convoy](http://codeconvoy.com), and I continue to work to grow these programs and promote education in any way that I can. I believe the best education is deeply interdisciplinary, a lifelong practice, defined mainly by enthusiasm and curiosity, and that education is the ["practice of freedom."](https://amzn.com/0415908086)

# This blog will self-destruct in...

I experiment quite a bit on this site, changing its focus and content regularly. I [write](/), share [drawings and paintings](/sketchbook), and do [weird](http://sandcastle.co/kirby/) web development [experiments](/stats).

This site is made with deep affection for the tools used to make it: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Github](http://github.com), [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and [Atom](https://atom.io).
