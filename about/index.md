##### Hi, I'm Kevin. I'm a teacher, designer, and web developer.

More than anything I love learning about and practicing creativity and sharing what I learn through teaching, writing, and other projects. I make [websites](/projects), [drawings, paintings](/sketchbook), and lots of other things. I'm also a mentor in the frontend web development course at [Bloc](http://bloc.io), where I help people as they learn how to make websites. I like simplicity, books, chess, tea, mindfulness, and trying to figure out how creativity works. My favorite word is "studio."

# This blog will self-destruct in...

I experiment quite a bit on this site, mainly rambling to myself about things that I'm interested in. Topics tend to revolve around the creative process, design, art, mindfulness, and web development.

This site is made with deep affection for the tools used to make it: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Github](http://github.com), [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and [TextMate](http://macromates.com).
